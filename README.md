# HAL-Hydrophone-Acoustic-Localisation
HAL: Hydrophone Acoustic Localisation for ROS2.

HAL is a ROS2 package for streaming, processing and publishing of raw acoustic data from mounted hydrophones. This package is developed for the use of marine robotics or marine vehicles. A system of three acoustic hydrophones are used for localisation methods to give quick and efficient localisation functionality in order to track acoustically tagged targets.
